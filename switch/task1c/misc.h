 *  This file contains miscellaneous structures that might
 *  be useful in your assignment.  
 *
 *  The following structures are defined here.
 *
 *    ip_address_t 
 *    port_t 
 *    packet_t
 *
 *  In addition, function prototypes are provided for some
 *  routines that manipulate these structures that you might
 *  find useful.  The routines themselves can be found in
 *  misc.c

 *  This structure stores a single destination IP address.    *
 *  An IP address contains four integers.                     *

 *  a destination IP address and a payload.  In our           *
 *  implementation, the payload is just an integer (how       *

 *  This structure stores a single input or output port.      *
 *  A port has three fields.  The first is the mutex.  This   *
 *  allows us to enforce mutual exclusion for this object.    *
 *  The second parameter is a packet; when a packet is sent   *
 *  through a port, it is stored here.  The final field is    *
 *  a flag that indicates whether the port contains a valid   *
 *  packet or not.  The assignment handout contains more      *
 *  details on how this structure is used.                    *
