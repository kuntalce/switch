 *  This file contains miscellaneous routines that might
 *  be useful in your assignment.  You don't need to use
 *  any of them.  In particular, this file provides routines
 *  that will allow easy manipulations of variables of
 *  the following types:
 *
 *    ip_address_t 
 *
 *  Each of these types are defined in misc.h.  You should
 *  really start by reading misc.h

 *                                                         *
 * This routine is used to copy one variable of type       *
 * ip_address_t to another variable of type ip_address_t.  *
 * Note that both the source and destination parameters    *
 * are passed by REFERENCE.  In other words, addresses are *
 * passed to the two variables rather than the variables   *
 * themselves.                                             *
 *                                                         *
 * To use this routine, you might imagine code that looks  *
 * something like this:                                    *
 *    ip_address_t  s, d;                                  *
 *    ..                                                   *
 *    ip_address_copy ( &s, &d )                           *
 *                                                         *
 * The ampersand is used to pass the address of s and d    *
 * rather than s and d themselves.  If this confuses       *
 * you, see any C book for a more detailed explanation.    *
 *                                                         *
