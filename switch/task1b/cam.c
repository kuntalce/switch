 *  Routing Table Routines

 *  Created by _________, University of British Columbia

 *  This is where you will put your routines to implement
 *  the routing table.  You should use the headers as
 *  supplied.  All your code will go in this
 *  file (and in cam.h)

/* Note that you probably want to have a data structure
   that is accessable to all routines in this file.  To do
   this, you probably would define some structure (perhaps
   called cam_t in the file cam.h.  Then you could 
   create a variable of this type here by using:

   cam_t cam;

   This will create  a variable called cam (of type cam_h)
   that can be accessed by any routine in this file.  */
