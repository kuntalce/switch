 *  here, unless you want to change something for testing 
 *  purposes.  If you do change anything, make sure that when
 *  you are done it works with the original test harness, since
 *  that is what we will use to mark your code.

 *  The thread has two purposes: to send packets at random    *
 *  through the input ports, and extract packets from the     *
 *  output ports as they appear.  The thread keeps track of   *
 *  how many sent packets are recieved; from this, the number *
 *  of dropped packets can be calculated.                     *
